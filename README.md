# React + TypeScript + Vite

This project is a simple task list application built with **React** and **TypeScript** using **Vite** as the build tool. It provides a minimal setup for modern frontend development with a focus on a component-based architecture and a clean user interface.

## üê≥ Docker

This project can be run in a Docker container, providing a consistent and isolated environment.

### Dockerfile

The included `Dockerfile` uses a multi-stage build. The first stage uses a Node.js image to install dependencies and run the production build. The second stage uses a lightweight Nginx image and only copies the final, static build files, resulting in a minimal and production-ready image.

### How to Run with Docker

1.  **Build the Docker Image**

    Navigate to the project root and build the image.

    ```sh
    docker build -t task-list-frontend .
    ```

2.  **Run the Docker Container**

    Map a port on your local machine (e.g., 8080) to the container's port 80.

    ```sh
    docker run -p 8080:80 task-list-frontend
    ```

    The application will be available in your web browser at `http://localhost:8080`.
